# CloseHaul
Global Game Jam 2020 Entry: Close Haul

Race your Sail boat while repairing it from the perils of the open sea! Play as a crew of two (single player switches between the two, two players can each play their part) As the Mainsheet Trimmer you're in charge of the direction of the Main Sheet/Sail to determine how fast the boat moves. You can also raise and lower the Main Sail to repair it. As the Helmsman you're in charge of the Tiller and can control the direction of the ship, navigating the buoys and rocks. Work together with a friend or coordinate things yourself to steer and and change speed so that you stay afloat and reach the finish line first! Each position has an action to do a quick repair or a long repair. Long repairs last longer, but they take longer to perform. Mainsheet trimmers will patch tears in the main sheet or just lower it to avoid damage, at the cost of speed. Helmsmen will bail water to quickly stay afloat, or plug holes to solve the leak longer.
